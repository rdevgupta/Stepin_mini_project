## INTRODUCTION
>The idea is very simple that to maintain database of students in schools and colleges, Instead of using traditional paper work method where man power is required so much. We can use a simple program that will handle all the operations related to database management of students.
>By completing this project, I will bring all the concepts of C programming that I have learned so far during my STEPIN program in practice.

## FEATURES/OPERATIONS OF PROJECT
- **CREATE DATABASE**
- **VIEW DATABASE**
- **MODIFY DATABASE**
- **SEARCH DATABASE**
- **DELETE DATABASE**

## DESCRIPTION
- In this project User will see a menu asking the user to choose a particular operation. 
- When User chooses an operation it will perform that. 
- When Creating a data entry program will ask for some data regarding the student such as Name, Branch, Roll number, Course and Phone number etc. 
- When User wish to view the Database he can see the whole data in a tabular form. 
- User can Modify the data by entering the Name of the student and then by entering it's updated information.
- If User wishes to see a specific student's data he can search that student by it's name.
- If a student no longer is present in school User can delete the data by searching the data of the student.
- We can add as many features as we want like father's name, hometown etc. just by some little changes in code.
- Whole idea behind this project is to bring everything learned about C programming in practice.
